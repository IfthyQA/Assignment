# Assignment

Please Run the Flipkart Script on April 15th. I automated on Aprill 11th with the normal flipkart page and then started to writing test cases.

Since yesterday the "Big Saving Days" Sales are going on between April 12th to 14th, the Flipkart home page and mobile page has been changed with offer banners now. so please run this script on April 15th, because from April 15th the page will be a normal one without any offer banners. 

Otherwise If i change the script today as per the today's flipkart page, and the reviewer runs the script after April 15th it will break again, as the banner will be removed and it will be normal one.

Thanks for understanding.
